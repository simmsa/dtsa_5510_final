But, one of the things I greatly dislike about the cafeteria rule is that when lunch time ends the para turn off the lights and if it doesn't get silent then they get kinda mad... Then when they allow us to go, they dismiss us by table... That isn't the best. But, besides that, I believe the education is fantastic. ALA is definitely amazing. The amount of chrome books the school has is uncountable. Getting to my locker and to class is SO much easier than I thought it would be.

All of these people were completely committed to helping our daughter be in the best place for her entire personality. The only complaint we have is with their TaG program--it's understaffed and not geared toward individual students, which is beyond their control. Unbeknownst to us, Vermont has the highest allocation of dollars per student in the country--Colorado is 27th! Not only that, but the Colorado Supreme Court recently ruled on yet another decrease in state funding for education. How can children possibly get a leg up in life if education funding is continually pared down? Therefore, despite these challenges, we are very impressed with the level of professionalism, care, time, and energy this school has dedicated to our daughter. We couldn't ask for more.

A few teachers have taken the time to call or e-mail, that's right a personal phone call, to let me know that my son could do better on a certain assignment or to set up extra time for help. This just confirmed that we are in the right place. This has happened numerous occasions. The athletics are competitive as well as giving many a chance to play that would not be able to compete in a larger school. Many athletes have received scholarships to top rated school to continue competing. A study skills class has been instrumental in one of our boys success. He now feels equipped and confident to go to college. the support he receives from the teacher is fabulous. The teacher really takes the time to know him and how he learns.

Then when they allow us to go, they dismiss us by table... That isn't the best. But, besides that, I believe the education is fantastic. ALA is definitely amazing. The amount of chrome books the school has is uncountable. Getting to my locker and to class is SO much easier than I thought it would be.

Monarch provides students with *choices* of classes - you don't HAVE to take all AP classes (nor are you *required* to take the AP tests), and your elective choices are vast (the main reason why my child switched schools). Homework load is acceptable for the rigor of the courses my child is taking. Monarch provides students with the time to actually have FUN in their off-hours, rather than being tied to schoolwork/homework for what seems like all hours of the day, including weekends. I cannot speak to Special Ed accomodations, as they do not apply in my child's case. As far as drugs, don't fool yourselves - drug use (including alcohol) is at *every* school in the district and neighboring districts - and parents should be dealing with their students on this in conjunction with the school. Teachers - yes, some do overtly express their political viewpoints, and in some situations (not all!), it does add to the classroom discussion of the topic. High school is a time for students to learn how to deal with situations and a variety of personalities (similar to experiences with college professors, future bosses and coworkers!). Monarch gives students the opportunity to figure out how to manage homework loads, how to prepare/study for tests in class (not talking about standardized), how to deal with viewpoints different from your own in a respectful way, to name a few. The one area that would benefit from some additional staff is the Counseling Department. The 4 counselors on staff do a great job for each having a 400-500 student caseload - which is a ridiculous number of students to be managing. I don't think administration at the district level understands the amount of time it takes to provide outstanding counseling (for college and other high school issues) to individual students - it is next to impossible with their current caseload."", 'reviewerRating': 5, 'lastUpdatedDate': 'March 2023', 'institutionGreatschoolId': 800179, 'maponicsId': 4724579, 'url': 'https://www.greatschools.org/colorado/louisville/179-Monarch-High-School/'}], 'schoolGranularRatings': [{'schoolId': 96243, 'dataSourceId': 64, 'schoolGranularRatingType': 'College Readiness', 'schoolGranularRatingValue': '9', 'schoolGranularRatingCopyText': 'This school is above the state average in key measures of college and career readiness, such as graduation rates, college entrance exams, and advanced courses.\n\nEven at schools with strong college and career readiness, there may be students who are not getting the opportunities they need to succeed.\n', 'schoolGranularRatingsDescription': ""The College Readiness Rating uses this high school's graduation rates, college entrance exam participation and performance, or AP, IB, or Dual Enrollment participation to determine how well schools are preparing students for success in college and beyond.

But, one of the things I greatly dislike about the cafeteria rule is that when lunch time ends the para turn off the lights and if it doesn't get silent then they get kinda mad... Then when they allow us to go, they dismiss us by table... That isn't the best. But, besides that, I believe the education is fantastic. ALA is definitely amazing. The amount of chrome books the school has is uncountable. Getting to my locker and to class is SO much easier than I thought it would be. The classrooms are close enough together that it will probably take 2 minutes for transition. But other than curriculum, there is gym, music, art, ect. But of course you can't forget recess.

Monarch provides students with *choices* of classes - you don't HAVE to take all AP classes (nor are you *required* to take the AP tests), and your elective choices are vast (the main reason why my child switched schools). Homework load is acceptable for the rigor of the courses my child is taking. Monarch provides students with the time to actually have FUN in their off-hours, rather than being tied to schoolwork/homework for what seems like all hours of the day, including weekends. I cannot speak to Special Ed accomodations, as they do not apply in my child's case. As far as drugs, don't fool yourselves - drug use (including alcohol) is at *every* school in the district and neighboring districts - and parents should be dealing with their students on this in conjunction with the school. Teachers - yes, some do overtly express their political viewpoints, and in some situations (not all!), it does add to the classroom discussion of the topic. High school is a time for students to learn how to deal with situations and a variety of personalities (similar to experiences with college professors, future bosses and coworkers!). Monarch gives students the opportunity to figure out how to manage homework loads, how to prepare/study for tests in class (not talking about standardized), how to deal with viewpoints different from your own in a respectful way, to name a few. The one area that would benefit from some additional staff is the Counseling Department. The 4 counselors on staff do a great job for each having a 400-500 student caseload - which is a ridiculous number of students to be managing. I don't think administration at the district level understands the amount of time it takes to provide outstanding counseling (for college and other high school issues) to individual students - it is next to impossible with their current caseload."", 'reviewerRating': 5, 'lastUpdatedDate': 'March 2023', 'institutionGreatschoolId': 800179, 'maponicsId': 4724579, 'url': 'https://www.greatschools.org/colorado/louisville/179-Monarch-High-School/'}], 'schoolGranularRatings': [{'schoolId': 96243, 'dataSourceId': 64, 'schoolGranularRatingType': 'College Readiness', 'schoolGranularRatingValue': '9', 'schoolGranularRatingCopyText': 'This school is above the state average in key measures of college and career readiness, such as graduation rates, college entrance exams, and advanced courses.\n\nEven at schools with strong college and career readiness, there may be students who are not getting the opportunities they need to succeed.\n', 'schoolGranularRatingsDescription': ""The College Readiness Rating uses this high school's graduation rates, college entrance exam participation and performance, or AP, IB, or Dual Enrollment participation to determine how well schools are preparing students for success in college and beyond.
