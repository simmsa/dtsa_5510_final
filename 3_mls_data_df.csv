All of these people were completely committed to helping our daughter be in the best place for her entire personality.

Teachers - yes, some do overtly express their political viewpoints, and in some situations (not all!), it does add to the classroom discussion of the topic. High school is a time for students to learn how to deal with situations and a variety of personalities (similar to experiences with college professors, future bosses and coworkers!). Monarch gives students the opportunity to figure out how to manage homework loads, how to prepare/study for tests in class (not talking about standardized), how to deal with viewpoints different from your own in a respectful way, to name a few.

The 4 counselors on staff do a great job for each having a 400-500 student caseload - which is a ridiculous number of students to be managing.
