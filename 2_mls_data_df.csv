All of these people were completely committed to helping our daughter be in the best place for her entire personality.

Unbeknownst to us, Vermont has the highest allocation of dollars per student in the country--Colorado is 27th!

The quality of the Middle School and Elementary School vary. Our students' success has resulted from hard work and the counselors or teachers they received. Since Peak to Peak (P2P) strives to be a teaching school, many young teachers come to work for P2P to gain experience. Once they do, they often leave (even mid-year) for other opportunities. This can affect students negatively. There is little support for students with disabilities, ADHD, Dyslexia, etc… The benefits of P2P are its mission, some extraordinary teachers, a small school environment, and the opportunities a K-12 school offers students to be known and understood in their journey through primary education. A good experience is to be had if you and your student persevere to overcome educational obstacles and find the support of like-minded teachers, students and parents. You’ll pay significantly more financially and in time for the opportunities this school provides."", 'reviewerRating': 4, 'lastUpdatedDate': 'March 2023', 'institutionGreatschoolId': 801959, 'maponicsId': 3688175, 'url': 'https://www.greatschools.org/colorado/lafayette/1959-Peak-To-Peak-Charter-School/'}], 'schoolGranularRatings': [{'schoolId': 337652, 'dataSourceId': 64, 'schoolGranularRatingType': 'Test Scores', 'schoolGranularRatingValue': '9', 'schoolGranularRatingCopyText': 'State test results at this school are above the state average, so students are likely performing at or above grade level.\n\nBecause state averages can be low, some students at this school may still not be performing at grade level.\n', 'schoolGranularRatingsDescription': 'The Test Score Rating examines how students at this school performed on standardized tests compared with other schools in the state.

We open enrolled in Centaurus when we moved to Boulder County. A few teachers have taken the time to call or e-mail, that's right a personal phone call, to let me know that my son could do better on a certain assignment or to set up extra time for help. This just confirmed that we are in the right place. This has happened numerous occasions. The athletics are competitive as well as giving many a chance to play that would not be able to compete in a larger school. Many athletes have received scholarships to top rated school to continue competing. A study skills class has been instrumental in one of our boys success. He now feels equipped and confident to go to college. the support he receives from the teacher is fabulous. The teacher really takes the time to know him and how he learns. The support we receive as a family and the overall experience with academics, clubs, athletics, engineering, studies has been a blessing!!!!!"", 'reviewerRating': 5, 'lastUpdatedDate': 'March 2023', 'institutionGreatschoolId': 800138, 'maponicsId': 2426861, 'url': 'https://www.greatschools.org/colorado/lafayette/138-Centaurus-High-School/'}], 'schoolGranularRatings': [{'schoolId': 94831, 'dataSourceId': 64, 'schoolGranularRatingType': 'Student Growth', 'schoolGranularRatingValue': '9', 'schoolGranularRatingCopyText': 'Students at this school are making average academic progress from one grade to the next compared to similar students in the state.', 'schoolGranularRatingsDescription': ""The Student Progress Rating measures whether students at this school are making academic progress over time based on student growth data provided by the Department of Education.
