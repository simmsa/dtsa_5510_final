My daughter applied to Manhattan Middle after visiting the Open House Night. It was clear that the teachers were enthusiastic and happy with their work and colleagues, that the Principal and Vice Principal have a vision of the kind of diverse, engaging school they wanted to cultivate. My child is not a mainstream typical kid, she\'s a bit quirky, bright and mostly kind. And she found many of the same when she started 6th grade. She often says the school ""all just seems to get along"" and ""everyone is friends with each other"".Of course, there were one or two teachers that were not as engaging as the rest. She has had mostly interesting and challenging coursework, some great passionate teachers (Social Studies, LA, Math) whom she respected and liked to see each day. Beyond the coursework and pre-pandemic, there were several great community events for families to participate in. The community culture was just as important as the academics for her choice since the middle school years can be tough. Music, theater and art are excellent and let\'s hope they can return to their fullest curriculum for future students. My daughter was in good hands and we wished she could have experienced her full final year without the COVID restrictions. We would highly recommend this school to families looking for a good community, great school leadership and solid teaching through these awkward early teen years.', 'reviewerRating': 5, 'lastUpdatedDate': 'March 2023', 'institutionGreatschoolId': 800136, 'maponicsId': 4923958, 'url': 'https://www.greatschools.org/colorado/boulder/136-Manhattan-Middle-School-Of-The-Arts-And-Academics/'}, {'schoolId': 38347590, 'reviewedBy': 'Student', 'datePosted': 'May 2020', 'review': ""It sucked.

Yes, of course there is drama here and there, but there is enough diversity that you can be yourself and find friends who are great for you. I LOVE the principal. She is open minded and cares deeply for the kids and the school. It is a place where kids can thrive. I love the diversity.

I've experienced both a lot of ups and downs during my time here.

On the downside, Fairview was the very place where I got my first taste of racism. Even when I spoke up, I don't think the issue was really dealt with. Additionally, the teachers here really care about their students. There are so many clubs one can be involved in (and it's easy to start a club too!) and there's really something for everyone. For me, I joined the debate team and it was definitely the best decision of my life. Not only did it help me improve my confidence and my argumentation skills, I made really good friends with my teammates. There were times that I wished I hadn't gone to Fairview, but overall, if I could go back in time to 8th grade when I was choosing a high school, I'd probably still choose Fairview.
